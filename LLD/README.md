# Low Level Design - SOLID Principles


S - Single Responsibility Principle - Class Should have single responsibility

O - Open/Closed Principle - Open for extension and closed for modification

L - Liskov Substitution Principle - Subclass should be able to override the parent class in such a way that it does not break the functionality of base class 

I - Interface Seggregation Principle - Should not force any client to implement interface which is irrelevent to them

D - Dependency Inversion Principle - High level modules should not depend on lower level module
