##Core Data:

Core Data is an object graph and persistence framework provided by Apple in the macOS and 
iOS operating systems. It was introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and iOS with iPhone SDK 
3.0. It allows data organized by the relational entityâ€“attribute model to be serialized 
into XML, binary, or SQLite stores.

##Delete Rules:

- Nullify
- Cascade
- Deny
- No Action


The default for entity relationships deletion rule is None.  It may or may not what you
want depending on how you want the app to behave.  A deeper understanding on how these
rules work may help you implement the correct behavior of your app and in some cases
simplify the removal process of a record.
